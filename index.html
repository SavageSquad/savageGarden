	<h1>Cool site guysssss.</h1>
	<p>I want to stand with you on
		a mountain
		I want to bathe with you in the sea
		I want to lay like this forever
		Until the sky falls down on me

		And when the stars are shining
		brightly in the velvet sky,
		I'll make a wish send it to heaven
		Then make you want to cry
		The tears of joy for all the
		pleasure and the certainty
		That we're surrounded by the
		comfort and protection of

		The highest powers
		In lonely hours
		The tears devour you
	</p>
